# How to eat well

Eating a healthy, balanced diet is an important part of maintaining good health.

Eating a variety of foods in the right proportions and amounts can help maintain a healthy weight and achieve your fitness goal.

## Food groups

Your should eat a wide range of foods. Aim to:

- base your meals on higher fibre starchy foods like rice, bread or potatoes
- eat at least 5 portions of various fruit and vegetables
- eat some beans, fish, eggs, meat or other protein
- have some dairy or dairy alternatives like soy milk and yogurt
- drink plenty of fluids, aim for 6 to 8 glasses per day

Cut down on foods that are high in fat, salt or sugar. Have these less often and in small amounts.

You do not have to include all the 5 foods groups in every meal, but try to do so in a day or a week.

## Get the right balance

It's easy to prefer certain foods over others. Indeed, most people eat too much saturated fat and sugar, and not enough fruit, vegetables or fibre.

To get a proper balance of nutrition, you should consume foods from the 5 food groups in the right proportions and amounts.

### Fruit and vegetables

Fruit and vegetables should make up for over a third of the food you eat each day. They are a good source of vitamins, minerals and fibre.

Most people aren't eating enough of fruit vegetables. Aim to eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables each day.

For fruit, a portion means:

- 2 or more small fruit - for example, 2 plums, 2 kiwifruit, 3 apricots or 7 strawberries
- 1 medium fruit, such as 1 apple, banana, pear or orange
- 1 slice of watermelon, 1 large slice of pineapple or 2 slices of mango

For vegetables, a portion is:

- 2 broccoli spears
- 3 heaped tablespoons of cooked carrots, peas or sweetcorn
- a medium tomato

### Starchy foods

Starchy carbohydrates should account for about a third of the food you eat.

They are a good source of energy and the main source of a range of nutrients in our diet.

Some people think starchy foods are fattening, but gram for gram they contain fewer than half the calories of fat.

Try wholegrain where possible to get more fibre. Fibre help you feel full, making wholegrain starchy foods a good choice if you're trying to lose weight.

Whole wheat bread, wholegrain breakfast cereals and brown rice are all good sources of fibre.

### Beans, fish, eggs and meat

Eat some beans, fish, eggs and meat.

These foods are good sources of protein, vitamins and minerals.

Aim for at least 2 portions of fish every week, 1 of which should be oily, such as salmon or mackerel.

As for meat, choose lean cuts and eat less processed meat like bacon, ham and sausages.

Regarding eggs, there is no recommended limit how many you should eat, but it's best to cook them without adding salt or fat.

### Dairy or alternatives

Have some dairy or dairy alternatives such as soy milk and yogurt.

Milk, soy milk and yogurt are good sources of protein, calcium and vitamins.

Aim for low-fat and low-sugar products where possible.

### Water and drinks

Drink plenty of water. Aim for 6 to 8 glasses per day.

Low-fat milk and low-sugar drinks, including tea and coffee, also count.

Fruit juice and smoothies also count towards your fluid consumption, but they can contain high levels of sugar, so limit these those drinks to a combined total of 150ml a day.
