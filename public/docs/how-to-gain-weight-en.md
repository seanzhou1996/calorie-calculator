# How to gain weight safely

## Are you underweight?

Being underweight is not good for you. It can contribute to a range of health problems, such as a weakened immune system, fragile bones and feeling tired.

You can check if you're underweight by calculating your body mass index (BMI):

BMI = weight(kilograms) / (height(meters) × height)

If your BMI is below 18.5, this suggests your weight may be too low.

There are several possible reasons for being underweight, including:

- having an underlying medical condition like an overactive thyroid
- having mental or emotional problems that have affected your eating habits
- not eating a healthy, balanced diet

Whatever the cause, if you're concerned about your weight, it's best to seek help from a health professional.

## Healthy diet for weight gain

If diet is the cause of your low weight, changing to a healthy, balanced diet with sufficient calorie intake can help you achieve a healthy weight.

Aim to gain weight gradually until you reach a healthy weight.

Avoid relying on high-calorie foods that contain lots of saturated fat and sugar to gain weight, as they will lead to increase in body fat instead of muscle.

Instead, base your diet on a variety of foods and eat the right amount. You should:

- base your meals on potatoes, bread, noodles, rice or other starchy carbohydrates, and choose wholegrain where possible
- eat at least 5 portions of various fruit and vegetables every day
- eat some fish, eggs, meat, beans or other protein
- have some milk or alternatives like soy milk and yogurt
- drink plenty of fluids, aim for 6 to 8 glasses every day

Try to cut down on foods that are high in fat, salt or sugar. Have these less often and in small amounts.

## Food for fitness

Eating the right food at the right time can help you get the most out of sport and fitness activities.

### Carbohydrate

Carbohydrate is your body's main source of energy and can help you perform at your best, no matter what sports or activities.

In general, the more exercise you do, the more carbohydrate you need to include in your daily meals and around exercise.

Healthy sources of carbohydrate include:

- brown rice
- potatoes (with skins on)
- fresh fruit
- whole wheat bread
- wholegrain cereals

### Protein

Protein helps build muscles.

Most of us can get sufficient protein from a healthy, balanced diet without having to increase protein intake significantly.

Here are some healthy sources of protein:

- fish
- eggs
- lean cuts of meat
- milk, soy milk and yogurt
- tofu
- beans

To optimize muscle building, have a source of protein at each meal. Consume some protein-rich food before and after an exercise session to kickstart the muscle repair process.

### Water

Not drinking enough water can have a major impact on your physical performance.

It can lead to rise in body temperature, reduced motivation and increased fatigue, making exercise feel much more difficult, both physically and mentally.

To maximize performance, keep your body well hydrated throughout an fitness session. This means:

- for moderate exercise that lasts less than an hour, drink some water at rest intervals
- for harder sessions that last longer than an hour, have an isotonic sports drink or a combination of high-carbohydrate food and water

### Food before exercise

Allow about 3 hours before you exercise after having a main meal, such as lunch or dinner.

An hour before exercise, have a light snack that provides some protein and carbohydrate to boost your performance during training and speed up recovery afterwards.

Choose a snack that you'll digest quickly, such as:

- a slice of wholegrain bread
- a banana
- a glass of milk or alternatives

Avoid eating fatty foods or high-fibre foods as they may cause stomach discomfort if eaten just before exercise.

### Food after exercise

Refill yourself with carbohydrate and protein to help your body recover from training.

During exercise, your muscles use up glycogen, their primary fuel source. Meanwhile, some proteins in your muscles become damaged.

Carbohydrate is essential for rebuilding glycogen stores, while protein can help your body repair damaged muscle proteins and build new muscle tissues.

Therefore, you should consume a combination of carbohydrate and protein as soon as possible after exercise.

Make sure to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.
