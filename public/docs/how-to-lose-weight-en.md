# How to lose weight

Weight gain occurs when you regularly eat more calories than your body burns.

To lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories and burn more energy through physical activities.

It sounds simple, but half of Hongkongers aged 15 or older are overweight or obese. Modern lifestyles have seen many of us eating too many calories and not doing enough exercise.

## Hidden causes of weight gain

Consume more calories than our body uses results in weight gain, but the real-life habits that contribute to this are not always obvious. Do you recognize these hidden weight gain causes?

### Foods labeled "low-fat"

Various low-fat foods in the supermarket seem to be good choices for weight loss.

But low fat does not necessarily mean low calories. Some low-fat foods contain a lot of sugar and so can be of high calories, contributing to weight gain.

What you can do: read food labels and look for the number of calories per 100 grams or per serving. Choose what to buy based on this number.

### Stress

Work and family are putting increasing amounts of stress on many people, especially those living in big cities.

When under stress, it's easy for us to reach for a sugary pick-me-up. Do this often and you may put on weight.

What you can do: replace sugary snacks with lower-calorie foods, such as various of fruit, and do some exercise to combat stress.

### Portion sizes

Portion sizes in restaurants and supermarkets have increased in the past several decades.

Burgers, for example, have doubled in size since 1980.

For many of us, whether we want it or not, the more we're given, the more we eat.

What you can do: Cook smaller portions at home, avoid super-size portions when eating out. Eat slowly and stop when you feel full.

### Late nights

Late nights have become the norm for many people. But staying up late can contribute to weight gain.

The reason is not clear, but one theory suggests that sleep-deprived people have reduced levels of leptin, the chemical that makes you feel full, and higher levels of ghrelin, the hormone that stimulates hunger.

What you can do: get more sleep. Sleep is essential for physical and mental health. You'll feel wonderful when you wake up from a good night's sleep.

## Keys to weight loss

You eat fewer calories and do more physical activities to lose weight.

You must also make long-term changes to your diet and lifestyle that you can stick to.

This ensures you keep the weight off and won't undo your progress by going back to old habits.

### Eat lower-calorie foods

Choose lower-calorie foods where possible. Swap high-calorie foods for those that contain fewer calories. You can:

- swap cookies for fruit and yogurt
- swap cheesy sauces for vegetable-based sauces
- swap milkshakes for low-sugar tea

### Use the right cooking methods

Use methods that add fewer calories when cooking. You can choose:

- steaming
- boiling
- braising
- grilling
- roasting
- baking

Avoid fried or deep-fried foods as they contain more calories than non-fried counterparts. As an example, 100 grams of french fries contain 319 calories, more than 3 times the calories of a baked potato with the same weight.

### Eat regular meals

Eating meals regularly every day helps boost metabolism, meaning your body can burn calories at a faster rate. It also reduces the temptation to snack on foods high in fat and sugar.

### Be more active

Exercise helps burn the excess calories you cannot lose through diet alone. It can also reduce stress level and keep you happy.

The amount of activity you need to do depends on your age. Adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity a week or 75 vigorous intensity activity a week.

Examples of moderate intensity activities include:

- brisk walking
- riding a bike
- hiking
- dancing

Examples of vigorous activities include:

- football
- running
- swimming
- riding a bike fast
- walking up the stairs

It's not hard to achieve the target if you make activity part of your daily routine.

For instance, When taking the metro or bus to work, get off one stop early and walk to your office. When getting back home, use the stairs instead of taking the elevator.

Try to get your friends involved. You're more likely to keep active if you have fun and people to enjoy yourself with.

## Weight loss tips

### 1. Eat breakfast every day

Skipping breakfast will not help you lose weight. You could miss out on essential nutrients and you may end up snacking more throughout the day because you feel hungry.

### 3. Eat high fibre foods

Fibre can keep you feel full longer, making fibre-rich foods a good choice for weight loss. Apart from fruit and vegetables, fibre is also found in whole wheat bread, brown rice and beans.

### 4. Cut down on alcohol

Alcohol contains 7 calories per gram, almost twice as many calories as carbohydrates or proteins and just below fat. Over time, drinking too much can contribute to weight gain.

### 5. watch your weight

Weigh yourself regularly, like once a week, to keep track of your progress.

### 6. Keep it interesting

Try new things to add variety and fun to your journey. For example, download a new recipe, learn a sport, or sign up for a fitness class.

Goals can help motivate you into keeping up your healthy diet and exercise routine. For instance, think about someone you care or a up-coming occasion you want to be your best for.

## Other weight loss methods

Healthy eating and doing physical activities are the primary ways to lose weight.

But there are also radical approaches, such as intentional fasting and very low calorie diets.

These options aim to help you drop weight quickly, but can cause significant health impacts to your body.

Make sure to consult a health professional before you try these methods.

### Intentional fasting

Intentional fasting means restricting your diet to specific period of time.

You can eat normally during specific days in a week, or during certain hours in a day. In the remaining time, you need to eat very few or no calories.

Intentional fasting techniques include:

- 5:2 diet - Eating 500 to 600 calories on two non-consecutive days in a week, while eating normally for the remaining 5 days
- 16/8 fasting - restricting your daily eating window to 8 hours, fasting for the remaining 16 hours

These methods are not for everyone. They can cause dizziness and fatigue. Seek medical advice before you make a decision.

### Very low calorie diets

A very low calorie diet is a clinically supervised diet plan that involves eating around 800 calories a day or less.

Such diet can be suitable for adult who are obese or severely obese, defined as having a BMI over 30, and need to lose weight quickly.

But very low calorie diets should not become your first weight loss option.

Given the far less amount of food they contain, very low calorie diets are less likely to be nutritionally complete.

They are not easy diets to follow. Side effects can include:

- headaches
- dizziness
- diarrhea
- cramps
- hair thinning

Very low calorie diets are not a long-term weight management strategy. While they can cause weight drop in the short term, the weight is likely to come back after the diet ends.

Very low calorie diets are not suitable for most people. Do not follow such diets until your doctor has suggested one to you.
